# US-SouthOU-Demo

***This GitHub Enterprise Cloud Organization is for team members of Microsoft's South OU to use to provide demonstrations to their customers.***

As the number of repositories for this Organization will grow, please use the following best practices when setting up your repositories.

#### Naming Convention

1.  Provide a descriptive name to your repository.

|:bulb: Suggestion|Use a more descriptive name like `github-actions-training` rather than `gha-demo`|
|:---|:---|


#### README.md

1.  Provide a README.md file in the repository's root folder.

2.  The repository's README.md should describe the purpose of the repository and any other useful information for users of the repository.

#### Topics
